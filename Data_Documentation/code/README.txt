-All input data files may be found in input, they include 
	- ISIC_4_4digit (all 4 digit ISICS version 4 codes)
	- ISIC_31_4digit (all 4 digit ISICS version 3.1 codes)
	- ISIC4_ISIC31 (correspondence table of ISICS v.4 to ISICS v.3.1
-All code files may be found in code, they include
	- Tool_functions.py (the basic functions that make up the tool) 
	- main_script.py (the script where the functions are used to create a correspondence table 
	- var_scipt.py (the script used to get variance calculations and consider reproducibility)  

Instructions:
 
For simple tool use (main.script.py): 
1) download all files including correspondence table and files containing codes and descriptions from the old and new ISICS versions
2) Ensure all code files are saved in the same directory
3) Ensure necessary packages installed, specifically google-generativeai and wandb*
3) Run on command line using the following method: 
$ python main_script.py correspondence_table ISIC_old ISIC_new mod** out_file_name
4) Output correspondence table now saved in excel as out_file_name 
5) Typical runtime for the model is 5-10 minutes depending on the speed of the network calls to the google API

*Other necessary packages are pandas, numpy, and io 
**optional, default is 'gemini-pro', other options are 'gemini-pro-1.0' and 'gemini-pro-1.0-latest'

For variance tool use:
1) Ensure all files saved in the same location 
2) download necessary packages google-generativeai, and wandb***
3) run on command line as follows: 
$ python var_script.py correspondence_table ISIC_old ISIC_new mod**** outfile_xl out_file_png

4) this will return 2 files, an excel file showing each code pairing***** and its variance and an image of a histogram of these code pairings and variances for visual understanding 
5) Be warned, this requires overnight running normally of between 8-10 hours as the model must run 100 times

***Other necessary packages are pandas, numpy, and io 
****Must specify desired model, options are 'gemini-pro', 'gemini-pro-1.0' and 'gemini-pro-1.0-latest'
*****Only codes where a code in new version maps to multiple codes in older version will be included. Otherwise the variance with only a single mapping will bias our mean and median result downward as they will always have 0 variance.

Variable Name 		Storage Type		Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Industrycat_isic	bool (0,1)		ISIC code for individual’s job. If it is in 2009, it is in ISIC 3.1. In 2011, it is in ISIC 4.
urban			bool (0,1)		Binary variable that takes the value 1 if the individual is in a city, and 0 otherwise.
Male			bool (0,1)		Binary variable that takes the value 1 if the individual is male, and 0 otherwise.
literacy		bool (0,1)		binary variable that takes the value 1 if the individual can read and write, and 0 otherwise.
age			int			the age of the individual.
hsize			int			How many members the individual has in their household.
school			bool (0,1)		binary variable that takes the value 1 if the individual is attending school, and 0 otherwise.
marital			int			variable that takes the value 1 if an individual is married, 2 if never married, 3 if living together, 4 if divorced or separated, or 5 if widowed. Of note, for the actual analysis we made a new variable that takes the value 1 if married and 0 otherwise.
vocational		bool (0,1)		binary variable that takes the value 1 if an individual has received vocational training, and 0 otherwise. 
lstatus			int			variable that takes the value 1 if employed, 2 if unemployed, and 3 if not in the labor force. We made a new variable that’s 1 if employed, 0 otherwise. 
subnatid_1		character		variable that has the name of the state or territory the individual is from.
wage_no_compen		int			The wage an individual was last paid 
whours			int			The number of hours worked by an individual in the last week
